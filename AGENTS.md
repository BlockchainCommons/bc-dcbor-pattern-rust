# dcbor-pattern Crate Documentation

## STATUS: ✅ COMPLETED

The `dcbor-pattern` crate is **FEATURE COMPLETE** and production-ready. All functionality has been implemented and tested, with 379/379 tests passing.

### Final Project Status
- **✅ API Simplification**: Removed redundant wrapper methods, cleaner idiomatic Rust API
- **✅ Named Captures**: Full capture support for all pattern types including sequences
- **✅ All Pattern Types**: Value, structure, and meta patterns fully implemented
- **✅ Complete Parser**: Full text syntax parsing with operator precedence
- **✅ VM Integration**: Pattern matching virtual machine with capture support
- **✅ Comprehensive Testing**: 379+ tests covering all functionality
- **✅ Production Ready**: All tests pass, no clippy warnings, clean codebase

## Overview

This crate provides pattern matching and text syntax parsing for Deterministic CBOR (dCBOR) as implemented in the `dcbor` crate. It supports complex pattern matching with named captures, search patterns, and nested structures.

### Usage Example
```rust
use dcbor_pattern::{Matcher, Pattern};

// Parse a pattern with named captures
let pattern = Pattern::parse("@name(SEQUENCE(NUMBER, TEXT))")?;

// Match against CBOR data and collect captures
let (paths, captures) = pattern.paths_with_captures(&cbor_data);
```

## Development Guidelines

- Use `r#""#` syntax for pattern strings with embedded quotes
- Ensure `cargo test` and `cargo clippy` pass before committing
- Avoid `as_case` and `CBORCase` where possible - use the full `dcbor` API

## Architecture

### Pattern Types
- **Value Patterns**: Atomic CBOR values (bool, number, text, etc.)
- **Structure Patterns**: Compound structures (arrays, maps, tagged values)  
- **Meta Patterns**: Logical combinations (and, or, not, captures, search, etc.)

### Key Components
- `Pattern`: Main enum with parsing and matching functionality
- `Matcher` trait: Core matching interface with `paths_with_captures()`
- VM: Pattern matching virtual machine for complex patterns
- Parser: Text syntax parser supporting full dCBOR pattern language

### Dependencies
- `dcbor`: Core deterministic CBOR implementation
- `dcbor-parse`: Diagnostic notation parser for test data
- `known-values`: Registry of well-known CBOR values
- `bc-components`: Blockchain Commons components (for digest patterns)

## Implementation Status
